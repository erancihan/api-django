# Yet another Django API Template

## Roadmap, Plans, Ideas
- [ ] A basic forum API.
- [ ] Authentication.<br/>
  Support Firebase and regular login and make them work together
- [ ] ML back-end
  - [ ] MNIST handwritten digit recognition. Upload an image, report which digit it is.
- [ ] Docker Compose, CI/CD

## Why?
It felt like I might endup using a Python based framework more than once. And restructuring, adding every same feature over and over again sounded a tedious thing to do. And thus, I have opted to create a template repository, and add stuff into it instead.

Also get going with a open source project like thing. You gotta get started somewhere.

## Q & A ??
Q: Why would I want these sample projects that I won't use in my app!?<br/>
A: Well, you should be able to delete them if you don't want them. It's meant to be a template, update it however you want!

Q: There are things I want to see implemented, what do I do?<br/>
A: Prompt a discussion or an issue.
